let total = console.log(10,32);

console.log(total);




// Without running the code, predict and explain what total will evaluate to
// we predict 
   //console.log(console.log(10,32));
//console.log(10,32)
//10,32
//but after we run it we got 10,32 and undefined  ,and we understand that  if we assign the console.log to a variable we can get the parameter passed to console.log otherwise the console.log vcan't stand by it self and gives us undefined
